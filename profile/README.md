# PyScript

> Programming for the 99%

## Introduction

PyScript was concieved as an easy and accessible alternative for Python code compilation and deployment. PyScript will make it so that anyone can code in Python, regardless of their access to complex tools and other languages. All you need is a browser! Code in your browser and email your friend, professor, or colleague a link. It's as simple as that.
